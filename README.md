# Firebase: 'PERMISSION_DENIED' Error Despite Correct Rules

This repository demonstrates a common Firebase Realtime Database issue where a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error occurs even with seemingly correct security rules.  The root cause often lies in existing data that doesn't comply with the newly implemented, more restrictive rules.  The repository includes a bugged JavaScript file (`bug.js`) showing the problematic behavior and a fixed version (`solution.js`).

## Problem

After updating security rules in your Firebase Realtime Database, you may encounter `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors during read/write operations, even if the rules seem perfectly valid. This often happens if existing data in your database violates the new rules.

## Solution

The solution involves a two-pronged approach:

1. **Review and correct your Firebase Security Rules:** Ensure your rules correctly define read and write access based on user authentication and data structure.
2. **Clean up existing data violating rules:** Delete or update data in your database that contradicts your updated security rules.
